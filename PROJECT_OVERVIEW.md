## 🛠️ Recent Major Enhancements

### ❌ **"Why it" Truncation Issue - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: API responses were getting cut off mid-sentence (e.g., stopping at "Why it" instead of completing the explanation)

**Root Cause**: The `max_tokens` parameter was set to only 1000 tokens, which was insufficient for comprehensive explanations

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Increased Token Limit**: Expanded from 1000 to 3000 tokens (3x increase)
2. **Truncation Detection**: Added automatic detection of incomplete responses using `finish_reason`
3. **User Notifications**: Implemented informative messages when explanations are truncated
4. **Error Prevention**: Enhanced API response handling to prevent mid-sentence cutoffs

**Technical Changes**:

```python
# Before
"max_tokens": 1000,

# After
"max_tokens": 3000,  # Increased for comprehensive explanations

# Added truncation detection
finish_reason = data['choices'][0].get('finish_reason', '')
if finish_reason == 'length':
    explanation += "\n\n*[Note: This explanation was truncated due to length limits.]*"
```
