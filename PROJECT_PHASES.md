## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Enhancements (Must-Have)

### 🔁 Regenerate Explanation
- Add a button to regenerate the explanation for the same topic and level.
- Skips cache and fetches a new result from the API.
- Optionally replaces or stores multiple explanations in the database.

### 📊 Basic Usage Analytics
- Create an `/analytics` route in Flask backend to show:
  - Most searched concepts
  - Most selected difficulty levels
  - Cache hit/miss stats
- Frontend dashboard using charts (`recharts`, `chart.js`)

### 📜 Local History (Unauthenticated Users)
- Store the last 5–10 searched topics in browser `localStorage`.
- Show them in a collapsible sidebar or modal.
- Option to “Clear History”.

### 🎚️ Knowledge Depth Slider
- Replace dropdown with an interactive slider (1–4 levels):
  - 🍼 ELI5 | 🎒 Student | 🎓 Graduate | 🧠 Advanced
- Animate transitions between explanations as the level is changed.

- Save preference to `localStorage`.

### 🔐 Soft Login Prompt (Auth Light)

- On the 4th, show a login modal:
  > “Love what you're seeing? Sign in to continue learning.”
- Block further usage until user signs in.
- Basic username/email/password auth using Flask-JWT and React.

## 📦 Phase 3: Power Features (Nice-to-Have)

### 🧠 Explain Dependencies (Concept Tracing)

- Implement as a follow-up AI call or secondary prompt.

### 🌍 Multilingual Support
- Add a language selector.
